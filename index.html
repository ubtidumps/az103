                        2 or 3 is max value, depending on which region you are in.

                        Use 20 for platformUpdateDomainCount
                        <br />
                        Increasing the update domain (platformUpdateDomainCount) helps with capacity and availability
                        planning when the platform reboots nodes. A higher number for the pool (20 is max) means that
                        fewer of their nodes in any given availability set would be rebooted at once.

                    in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might
                    have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution.

                    After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result,

                    You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named Adatum and an Azure Subscription named
                    Subscription1. Adatum contains a group named
                    <br />
                    Developers. Subscription1 contains a resource group named Dev.
                    <br />
                    You need to provide the Developers group with the ability to create Azure logic apps in the Dev
                    resource group.
                    <br />
                    Solution: On Subscription1, you assign the DevTest Labs User role to the Developers group.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                        manageable and actionable.

                        prepare the virtual hard disk (VHD or VHDX). Azure supports only generation 1 VMs that are in
                        the VHD file format and have a fixed sized disk. The maximum size allowed for the VHD is 1,023
                        GB. You can convert a generation 1 VM from the VHDX file system to VHD and from a dynamically
                        expanding disk to fixed-sized.

                        <br />
                        You apply tags to your Azure resources giving metadata to logically organize them into a
                        taxonomy. After you apply tags, you can retrieve all the resources in your subscription with
                        that tag name and value. Each resource or resource group can have a maximum of 15 tag name/value
                        pairs. Tags applied to the resource group are not inherited by the resources in that resource
                        group.

                        After you get your services running, regularly check how much they're costing you. You can see
                        the current spend and burn rate in Azure portal.

                        1. Visit the Subscriptions blade in Azure portal and select a subscription.
                        <br />
                        You should see the cost breakdown and burn rate in the popup blade.
                        <br />
                        2. Click Cost analysis in the list to the left to see the cost breakdown by resource. Wait 24
                        hours after you add a service for the data to populate.
                        <br />
                        3. You can filter by different properties like tags, resource group, and timespan. Click Apply

                    The company also has two on-premises servers named Server1 and Server2 that run Windows Server 2016.
                    Server1 is configured as a DNS server that has a primary DNS zone named adatum.com. Adatum.com
                    contains 1,000 DNS records.

                        As an administrator, you may need to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent
                        other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources.
                        <br />
                        ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the
                        resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions
                        granted by the Reader role.
                        <br />
                        Incorrect Answers:
                        <br />
                        C: A ReadOnly lock on a resource group that contains a virtual machine prevents all users from
                        starting or restarting the virtual machine. These operations require a POST request.

                    HOTSPOT -
                    <br />
                    You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains the following resource group:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Name: RG1
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    ‚úë Tag: "tag1": "value1"
                    <br />
                    You assign an Azure policy named Policy1 to Subscription1 by using the following configurations:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Exclusions: None
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Policy definition: Append tag and its default value
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Assignment name: Policy1
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Parameters:
                    <br />
                    - Tag name: Tag2
                    <br />
                    - Tag value: Value2
                    <br />
                    After Policy1 is assigned, you create a storage account that has the following configurations:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Name: storage1
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Location: West US
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Resource group: RG1
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Tags: "tag3": "value3"
                    <br />
                    You need to identify which tags are assigned to each resource.
                    <br />
                    What should you identify? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
                    <br />
                    NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

                    You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1. Subscription1 contains a resource group named
                    RG1. RG1 contains resources that were deployed by using templates.
                    <br />
                    You need to view the date and time when the resources were created in RG1.
                    <br />
                    Solution: From the RG1 blade, you click Deployments.

                    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This
                    may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.
                    <br />
                    When the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will
                    perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as
                    it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g, copy and paste, ability to navigate to
                    external websites) will not be possible by design.
                    <br />
                    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it
                    doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for
                    that task.
                    <br />
                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be
                    able to return to the lab.
                    <br />
                    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

                    You plan to prevent users from accidentally deleting blob data from Azure.
                    <br />
                    You need to ensure that administrators can recover any blob data that is deleted accidentally from
                    the storagelod9272261 storage account for 14 days after the deletion occurred.
                    <br />
                    What should you do from the Azure portal?

                    doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for
                    that task.

                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be
                    able to return to the lab.
                    <br />
                    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

                        <br />
                        Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.
                        <br />
                        A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are
                        kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an
                        Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on
                        registered server.

                        Locally-redundant storage (LRS): A simple, low-cost replication strategy. Data is replicated
                        within a single storage scale unit.
                        <br />
                        Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS): Cross-regional replication with read access to the
                        replica. RA-GRS provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location, in addition to
                        geo-replication across two regions, but is more expensive compared to GRS.

                    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This
                    may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.
                    <br />
                    When the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will
                    perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as
                    it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g, copy and paste, ability to navigate to
                    external websites) will not be possible by design.
                    <br />
                    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it
                    doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for
                    that task.
                    <br />
                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be
                    able to return to the lab.
                    <br />
                    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

                    <br />
                    You need to configure the storage account to store the media files. The solution must ensure that

                        Step 1 (E): Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1
                        <br />
                        The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced
                        with an Azure file share
                        <br />
                        Step 2 (B): Register Server1.
                        <br />
                        Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service
                        <br />
                        Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship
                        between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.
                        <br />
                        Step 3 (C): Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.
                        <br />
                        A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are
                        kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an
                        Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on
                        registered server.

                        Create an import job in your target storage account in Azure portal. Upload the drive journal
                        files.
                        <br />
                        Step 3: Detach the external disks from Server1 and ship the disks to an Azure data center.
                        <br />
                        Provide the return address and carrier account number for shipping the drives back to you.
                        <br />
                        Ship the disk drives to the shipping address provided during job creation.
                        <br />
                        Step 4: From the Azure portal, update the import job
                        <br />
                        Update the delivery tracking number in the import job details and submit the import job.
                        <br />
                        The drives are received and processed at the Azure data center.
                        <br />
                        The drives are shipped using your carrier account to the return address provided in the import
                        job.

                        Step 1: Create a Storage Sync Service
                        <br />
                        The deployment of Azure File Sync starts with placing a Storage Sync Service resource into a
                        resource group of your selected subscription.
                        <br />
                        Step 2: Install the Azure File Sync agent
                        <br />
                        The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced
                        with an Azure file share.
                        <br />
                        When the Azure File Sync agent installation is finished, the Server Registration UI
                        automatically opens. You must have a Storage Sync Service before registering.
                        <br />
                        (Step 3: Run Server Registration
                        <br />
                        Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship
                        between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service. A server can only be registered
                        to one Storage Sync Service and can sync with other servers and Azure file shares associated
                        with the same Storage Sync
                        <br />
                        Service. )

                        Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your data synchronously across three storage clusters in
                        a single region.

                        GRS and RA GRS use asynchronous replication.

                        Rule2 blocks ports 50-60, which includes port 53, the DNS port. Internet users can reach the Web
                        server, since it uses port 80.
                        <br />
                        Box 2:
                        <br />
                        If Rule2 is removed internet users can reach the DNS server as well.
                        <br />
                        Note: Rules are processed in priority order, with lower numbers processed before higher numbers,
                        because lower numbers have higher priority. Once traffic matches a rule, processing stops. As a
                        result, any rules that exist with lower priorities (higher numbers) that have the same
                        attributes as rules with higher priorities are not processed.

                        To restore files or folders from the recovery point, go to the virtual machine and choose the
                        desired recovery point.
                        <br />
                        Step 0. In the virtual machine's menu, click Backup to open the Backup dashboard.
                        <br />
                        Step 1. In the Backup dashboard menu, click File Recovery.
                        <br />
                        Step 2. From the Select recovery point drop-down menu, select the recovery point that holds the
                        files you want. By default, the latest recovery point is already selected.
                        <br />
                        Step 3: To download the software used to copy files from the recovery point, click Download
                        Executable (for Windows Azure VM) or Download Script (for Linux
                        <br />
                        Azure VM, a python script is generated).

                        Step 4: Copy the files by using AzCopy
                        <br />
                        AzCopy is a command-line utility designed for copying data to/from Microsoft Azure Blob, File,
                        and Table storage, using simple commands designed for optimal performance. You can copy data

                    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This
                    may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.

                    <br />
                    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it

                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.

                    You plan to protect on-premises virtual machines and Azure virtual machines by using Azure Backup.
                    <br />
                    You need to prepare the backup infrastructure in Azure. The solution must minimize the cost of
                    storing the backups in Azure.

                    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This
                    may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.
                    <br />
                    When the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will
                    perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as
                    it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g, copy and paste, ability to navigate to
                    external websites) will not be possible by design.
                    <br />
                    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it
                    doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for
                    that task.
                    <br />
                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be
                    able to return to the lab.
                    <br />
                    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

                        Azure Backup provides backup for virtual machines "" created through both the classic deployment

                        With the release of backup policy management, customers can manage backup policies and model
                        them to meet their changing requirements from a single window. Customers can edit a policy,

                        Incorrect Answers:
                        <br />
                        B: You can't delete a Recovery Services vault if it is registered to a server and holds backup
                        data. If you try to delete a vault, but can't, the vault is still configured to receive backup
                        data.

                        You can use extensions to configure diagnostics on your VMs to collect additional metric data.
                        <br />
                        The basic host metrics are available, but to see more granular and VM-specific metrics, you need
                        to install the Azure diagnostics extension on the VM. The Azure diagnostics extension allows
                        additional monitoring and diagnostics data to be retrieved from the VM.

                        You can find unused disks in the Azure Storage Explorer console.Once you drill down to the Blob
                        containers under a storage account, you can see the lease state of the residing VHD (the lease
                        state determines if the VHD is being used by any resource) and the VM to which it is leased out.
                        If you find that the lease state and the VM fields are blank, it means that the VHD in question
                        is unused. The screenshot below shows two active VHDs being used by VMs as data and OS disks.

                    You have an availability set named AS1 that contains three virtual machines named VM1, VM2, and VM3.
                    <br />

                    You need to ensure that the resize operation succeeds.
                    <br />

                        Step 1: Stop VM1, VM, and VM3.
                        <br />
                        If the VM you wish to resize is part of an availability set, then you must stop all VMs in the
                        availability set before changing the size of any VM in the availability set.
                        <br />
                        The reason all VMs in the availability set must be stopped before performing the resize
                        operation to a size that requires different hardware is that all running VMs in the availability
                        set must be using the same physical hardware cluster. Therefore, if a change of physical
                        hardware cluster is required to change the VM size then all VMs must be first stopped and then
                        restarted one-by-one to a different physical hardware clusters.
                        <br />
                        Step 2: Resize VM1.
                        <br />
                        Step 3: Start VM1, VM2, and VM3.

                        The Warning state indicates one or more issues in VM's configuration that might lead to backup
                        failures and provides recommended steps to ensure successful backups. Not having the latest VM
                        Agent installed, for example, can cause backups to fail intermittently and falls in this class

                        1. Go to the resource group for your new resource group. Notice that the portal shows the result

                        2. You see a history of deployments for the group. In your case, the portal probably lists only
                        one deployment. Select this deployment.

                        <br />
                        3. The portal displays a summary of the deployment. The summary includes the status of the
                        deployment and its operations and the values that you provided for parameters. To see the
                        template that you used for the deployment, select View template.

                    You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1. VM1 was deployed by using a custom Azure Resource
                    Manager template named ARM1.json.

                    You receive a notification that VM1 will be affected by maintenance.
                    <br />

                    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This
                    may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.
                    <br />
                    When the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will
                    perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as
                    it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g, copy and paste, ability to navigate to
                    external websites) will not be possible by design.
                    <br />
                    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it
                    doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for
                    that task.
                    <br />
                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be
                    able to return to the lab.
                    <br />
                    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

                    You plan to back up all the Azure virtual machines in your Azure subscription at 02:00 Coordinated
                    Universal Time (UTC) daily.
                    <br />
                    You need to prepare the Azure environment to ensure that any new virtual machines can be configured
                    quickly for backup. The solution must ensure that all the daily backups performed at 02:00 UTC are
                    stored for only 90 days.

                    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This
                    may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.
                    <br />
                    When the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will
                    perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as
                    it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g, copy and paste, ability to navigate to
                    external websites) will not be possible by design.
                    <br />
                    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it
                    doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for
                    that task.

                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be
                    able to return to the lab.
                    <br />
                    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

                        Virtual Machine Scale Sets can be used with the Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC)
                        extension handler. Virtual machine scale sets provide a way to deploy and manage large numbers
                        of virtual machines, and can elastically scale in and out in response to load. DSC is used to
                        configure the VMs as they come online so they are running the production software.

                    VNet1 is in RG1. VNet2 is in RG2. There is no connectivity between VNet1 and VNet2.
                    <br />
                    An administrator named Admin1 creates an Azure virtual machine named VM1 in RG1. VM1 uses a disk
                    named Disk1 and connects to VNet1. Admin1 then installs a custom application in VM1.
                    <br />
                    You need to move the custom application to VNet2. The solution must minimize administrative effort.

                        We cannot just move a virtual machine between networks. What we need to do is identify the disk
                        used by the VM, delete the VM itself while retaining the disk, and recreate the VM in the target
                        virtual network and then attach the original disk to it.

                    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This
                    may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.
                    <br />
                    When the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will
                    perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as
                    it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g, copy and paste, ability to navigate to
                    external websites) will not be possible by design.
                    <br />
                    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it
                    doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for
                    that task.
                    <br />
                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be
                    able to return to the lab.
                    <br />
                    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

                    You need to ensure that virtual machines can communicate across both virtual networks by using their

                        Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two Azure virtual networks. Once
                        peered, the virtual networks appear as one, for connectivity purposes.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Peer virtual networks -
                        <br />
                        Step 1. In the Search box at the top of the Azure portal, begin typing VNET01-USEA2. When
                        VNET01-USEA2 appears in the search results, select it.
                        <br />
                        Step 2. Select Peerings, under SETTINGS, and then select + Add, as shown in the following
                        picture:

                        <br />
                        Step 3. Enter, or select, the following information, accept the defaults for the remaining
                        settings, and then select OK.
                        <br />
                        Name: myVirtualNetwork1-myVirtualNetwork2 (for example)
                        <br />
                        Subscription: elect your subscription.
                        <br />
                        Virtual network: VNET01-USWE2 - To select the VNET01-USWE2 virtual network, select Virtual
                        network, then select VNET01-USWE2. You can select a virtual network in the same region or in a
                        different region.
                        <br />
                        Now we need to repeat steps 1-3 for the other network VNET01-USWE2:
                        <br />
                        Step 4. In the Search box at the top of the Azure portal, begin typing VNET01- USEA2. When
                        VNET01- USEA2 appears in the search results, select it.
                        <br />
                        Step 5. Select Peerings, under SETTINGS, and then select + Add.

                        You can filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network with a
                        network security group. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny
                        inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources.
                        <br />
                        A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to,
                        or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources.
                        <br />
                        Step A: Create a network security group
                        <br />
                        A1. Search for and select the resource group for the VM, choose Add, then search for and select
                        Network security group.
                        <br />
                        A2. Select Create.

                        <br />
                        The Create network security group window opens.
                        <br />
                        A3. Create a network security group
                        <br />
                        Enter a name for your network security group.
                        <br />
                        Select or create a resource group, then select a location.
                        <br />
                        A4. Select Create to create the network security group.
                        <br />
                        Step B: Create an inbound security rule to allows HTTPS over TCP port 443
                        <br />
                        B1. Select your new network security group.
                        <br />
                        B2. Select Inbound security rules, then select Add.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        B3. Add inbound rule -
                        <br />
                        B4. Select Advanced.
                        <br />
                        From the drop-down menu, select HTTPS.
                        <br />
                        You can also verify by clicking Custom and selecting TCP port, and 443.
                        <br />
                        B5. Select Add to create the rule.
                        <br />
                        Repeat step B2-B5 to deny TCP port 80
                        <br />
                        B6. Select Inbound security rules, then select Add.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        B7. Add inbound rule -
                        <br />
                        B8. Select Advanced.

                        <br />
                        Step C: Associate your network security group with a subnet
                        <br />
                        Your final step is to associate your network security group with a subnet or a specific network
                        interface.
                        <br />
                        C1. In the Search resources, services, and docs box at the top of the portal, begin typing
                        Web01. When the Web01 VM appears in the search results, select it.
                        <br />

                    Your company registers a domain name of contoso.com.
                    <br />
                    You create an Azure DNS zone named contoso.com, and then you add an A record to the zone for a host
                    named www that has an IP address of 131.107.1.10.
                    <br />
                    You discover that Internet hosts are unable to resolve www.contoso.com to the 131.107.1.10 IP
                    address.
                    <br />
                    You need to resolve the name resolution issue.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You create a PTR record for www in the contoso.com zone.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                    Your company registers a domain name of contoso.com.
                    <br />
                    You create an Azure DNS zone named contoso.com, and then you add an A record to the zone for a host
                    named www that has an IP address of 131.107.1.10.
                    <br />
                    You discover that Internet hosts are unable to resolve www.contoso.com to the 131.107.1.10 IP
                    address.
                    <br />
                    You need to resolve the name resolution issue.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You modify the name servers at the domain registrar.

                        Note: The SOA record stores information about the name of the server that supplied the data for
                        the zone; the administrator of the zone; the current version of the data file; the number of
                        seconds a secondary name server should wait before checking for updates; the number of seconds a

                    Your company registers a domain name of contoso.com.
                    <br />
                    You create an Azure DNS zone named contoso.com, and then you add an A record to the zone for a host
                    named www that has an IP address of 131.107.1.10.
                    <br />
                    You discover that Internet hosts are unable to resolve www.contoso.com to the 131.107.1.10 IP
                    address.
                    <br />
                    You need to resolve the name resolution issue.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You add an NS record to the contoso.com Azure DNS zone.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                        The virtual networks can be in the same or different regions, and from the same or different
                        subscriptions. When connecting VNets from different subscriptions, the subscriptions do not need
                        to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.
                        <br />
                        Configuring a VNet-to-VNet connection is a good way to easily connect VNets. Connecting a
                        virtual network to another virtual network using the VNet-to-VNet connection type (VNet2VNet) is
                        similar to creating a Site-to-Site IPsec connection to an on-premises location. Both
                        connectivity types use a VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE, and both
                        function the same way when communicating.
                        <br />
                        The local network gateway for each VNet treats the other VNet as a local site. This lets you
                        specify additional address space for the local network gateway in order to route traffic.

                    You have an Azure subscription that contains two virtual networks named VNet1 and VNet2. Virtual
                    machines connect to the virtual networks.
                    <br />
                    The virtual networks have the address spaces and the subnets configured as shown in the following
                    table.

                    <br />
                    You need to add the address space of 10.33.0.0/16 to VNet1. The solution must ensure that the hosts
                    on VNet1 and VNet2 can communicate.

                        You can't add address ranges to, or delete address ranges from a virtual network's address space

                        To add or remove address ranges, delete the peering, add or remove the address ranges, then
                        re-create the peering.

                        Step 2: Add the 10.44.0.0/16 address space to VNet1.

                        B: A VPN gateway is used when creating a VPN connection to your on-premises network.
                        <br />
                        Route-based VPN devices use any-to-any (wildcard) traffic selectors, and let routing/forwarding
                        tables direct traffic to different IPsec tunnels. It is typically built on router platforms
                        where each IPsec tunnel is modeled as a network interface or VTI (virtual tunnel interface).
                        <br />
                        C: Policy-based VPN devices use the combinations of prefixes from both networks to define how
                        traffic is encrypted/decrypted through IPsec tunnels. It is typically built on firewall devices
                        that perform packet filtering. IPsec tunnel encryption and decryption are added to the packet
                        filtering and processing engine.

                    Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question
                    in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might

                    After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result,

                    You have an Azure subscription that contains 10 virtual networks. The virtual networks are hosted in
                    separate resource groups.
                    <br />
                    Another administrator plans to create several network security groups (NSGs) in the subscription.
                    <br />
                    You need to ensure that when an NSG is created, it automatically blocks TCP port 8080 between the
                    virtual networks.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You create a resource lock, and then you assign the lock to the subscription.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                    You have an Azure subscription that contains 10 virtual networks. The virtual networks are hosted in
                    separate resource groups.
                    <br />
                    Another administrator plans to create several network security groups (NSGs) in the subscription.
                    <br />
                    You need to ensure that when an NSG is created, it automatically blocks TCP port 8080 between the
                    virtual networks.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You configure a custom policy definition, and then you assign the policy to the
                    subscription.

                        <br />
                        A: Rules are processed in priority order, with lower numbers processed before higher numbers,
                        because lower numbers have higher priority. Once traffic matches a rule, processing stops. RDP
                        already has the lowest number and thus the highest priority.
                        <br />
                        B: The network interface has already been added to VM.
                        <br />
                        C: The Outbound rules are fine.

                        Azure DNS provides automatic registration of virtual machines from a single virtual network
                        that's linked to a private zone as a registration virtual network. VM5 does not belong to the
                        registration virtual network though.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Box 2: No -
                        <br />
                        Forward DNS resolution is supported across virtual networks that are linked to the private zone
                        as resolution virtual networks. VM5 does belong to a resolution virtual network.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Box 3: Yes -
                        <br />
                        VM6 belongs to registration virtual network, and an A (Host) record exists for VM9 in the DNS
                        zone.
                        <br />
                        By default, registration virtual networks also act as resolution virtual networks, in the sense
                        that DNS resolution against the zone works from any of the virtual machines within the
                        registration virtual network.

                        Rule 2 is blocking HTTPS access (port 443) and has a priority of 500.
                        <br />
                        Changing Rule 5 (ports 50-5000) and giving it a lower priority number will allow access on port
                        443.
                        <br />
                        Note: Rules are processed in priority order, with lower numbers processed before higher numbers,
                        because lower numbers have higher priority. Once traffic matches a rule, processing stops.

                        Incorrect Answers:
                        <br />
                        A: Rule 2 is blocking HTTPS access (port 443) and has a priority of 500. Creating a rule for the
                        same protocol (443) with a higher priority number will not help.
                        <br />
                        C: Rule 1 blocks access to port 80, which is used for HTTP, not HTTPS.
                        <br />
                        D: Rule 2 is blocking HTTPS access (port 443). Changing Rule 4 allows access on UDP but is a
                        higher priority number than Rule. Changing the protocol on Rule
                        <br />
                        4 to TCP will not help if we don't also change the priority to a lower number.

                    You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 contains four
                    subnets named Gateway, Perimeter, NVA, and Production.
                    <br />
                    The NVA subnet contains two network virtual appliances (NVAs) that will perform network traffic
                    inspection between the Perimeter subnet and the Production subnet.
                    <br />
                    You need to implement an Azure load balancer for the NVAs. The solution must meet the following
                    requirements:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë The NVAs must run in an active-active configuration that uses automatic failover.
                    <br />
                    ‚úë The NVAs must load balance traffic to two services on the Production subnet. The services have
                    different IP addresses.
                    <br />
                    Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
                    <br />
                    NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

                    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This
                    may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.
                    <br />
                    When the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will
                    perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as
                    it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g, copy and paste, ability to navigate to
                    external websites) will not be possible by design.
                    <br />
                    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it
                    doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for
                    that task.
                    <br />
                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be
                    able to return to the lab.
                    <br />
                    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

                        You can connect one VNet to another VNet using either a Virtual network peering, or an Azure VPN
                        Gateway.
                        <br />
                        To create a virtual network gateway
                        <br />
                        Step 1: In the portal, on the left side, click +Create a resource and type 'virtual network
                        gateway' in search. Locate Virtual network gateway in the search return and click the entry. On
                        the Virtual network gateway page, click Create at the bottom of the page to open the Create
                        virtual network gateway page.
                        <br />
                        Step 2: On the Create virtual network gateway page, fill in the values for your virtual network
                        gateway.

                        <br />
                        Name: Name your gateway. This is not the same as naming a gateway subnet. It's the name of the
                        gateway object you are creating.
                        <br />
                        Gateway type: Select VPN. VPN gateways use the virtual network gateway type VPN.
                        <br />
                        Virtual network: Choose the virtual network to which you want to add this gateway. Click Virtual
                        network to open the 'Choose a virtual network' page. Select the
                        <br />
                        VNet. If you don't see your VNet, make sure the Location field is pointing to the region in
                        which your virtual network is located.
                        <br />
                        Gateway subnet address range: You will only see this setting if you did not previously create a
                        gateway subnet for your virtual network. If you previously created a valid gateway subnet, this
                        setting will not appear.
                        <br />
                        Step 4: Select Create New to create a Gateway subnet.

                        <br />
                        Step 5: Click Create to begin creating the VPN gateway. The settings are validated and you'll
                        see the "Deploying Virtual network gateway" tile on the dashboard.
                        <br />
                        Creating a gateway can take up to 45 minutes. You may need to refresh your portal page to see
                        the completed status.

                    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This
                    may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.
                    <br />
                    When the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will
                    perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as
                    it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g, copy and paste, ability to navigate to
                    external websites) will not be possible by design.
                    <br />
                    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it
                    doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for
                    that task.
                    <br />
                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be
                    able to return to the lab.
                    <br />
                    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

                    network named VNet1. The point-to-site connection uses a self-signed certificate.
                    <br />
                    From Azure, you download and install the VPN client configuration package on a computer named
                    Computer2.
                    <br />
                    You need to ensure that you can establish a point-to-site VPN connection to VNet1 from Computer2.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You export the client certificate from Computer1 and install the certificate on Computer2.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.

                    You plan to create 100 Azure virtual machines on each of the following three virtual networks:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë VNET1005a
                    <br />
                    ‚úë VNET1005b
                    <br />
                    ‚úë VNET1005c
                    <br />
                    All the network traffic between the three virtual networks will be routed through VNET1005a.
                    <br />
                    You need to create the virtual networks, and then to ensure that all the Azure virtual machines can
                    connect to other virtual machines by using their private IP address. The solution must NOT require
                    any virtual network gateways and must minimize the number of peerings.
                    <br />
                    What should you do from the Azure portal before you configure IP routing?

                    You manage a virtual network named VNet1 that is hosted in the West US Azure region.
                    <br />
                    VNet1 hosts two virtual machines named VM1 and VM2 that run Windows Server.
                    <br />
                    You need to inspect all the network traffic from VM1 to VM2 for a period of three hours.
                    <br />
                    Solution: From Azure Network Watcher, you create a connection monitor.

                    You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains two Azure virtual networks named

                    VPNGW1 that uses static routing. There is a site-to-site VPN connection between your on-premises

                    <br />
                    On a computer named Client1 that runs Windows 10, you configure a point-to-site VPN connection to

                    <br />
                    You configure virtual network peering between VNet1 and VNet2. You verify that you can connect to

                    You manage a virtual network named VNet1 that is hosted in the West US Azure region.
                    <br />
                    VNet1 hosts two virtual machines named VM1 and VM2 that run Windows Server.
                    <br />
                    You need to inspect all the network traffic from VM1 to VM2 for a period of three hours.
                    <br />
                    Solution: From Performance Monitor, you create a Data Collector Set (DCS).

                        that receives traffic that the virtual machine needs to forward. A virtual machine can forward
                        traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it.

                        The routing table allows connections from VM3 to VM1 and VM2. And as IP forwarding is enabled on
                        VM3, VM3 can connect to VM1.

                        VM3, which has IP forwarding, must be turned on, in order for VM2 to connect to VM1.

                        The routing table allows connections from VM1 and VM2 to VM3. IP forwarding on VM3 allows VM1 to

                    You have an on-premises data center and an Azure subscription. The data center contains two VPN
                    devices. The subscription contains an Azure virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 contains a gateway
                    subnet.
                    <br />
                    You need to create a site-to-site VPN. The solution must ensure that is a single instance of an
                    Azure VPN gateway fails, or a single on-premises VPN device fails, the failure will not cause an
                    interruption that is longer than two minutes.
                    <br />
                    What is the minimum number of public IP addresses, virtual network gateways, and local network
                    gateways required in Azure? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
                    <br />
                    NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

                        The connection monitor capability monitors communication at a regular interval and informs you

                        Incorrect Answers:
                        <br />
                        A: The IP flow verify capability enables you to specify a source and destination IPv4 address,
                        port, protocol (TCP or UDP), and traffic direction (inbound or outbound). IP flow verify then
                        tests the communication and informs you if the connection succeeds or fails. If the connection
                        fails, IP flow verify tells you which security rule allowed or denied the communication, so that
                        you can resolve the problem.
                        <br />
                        C: The NSG flow log capability allows you to log the source and destination IP address, port,
                        protocol, and whether traffic was allowed or denied by an NSG.
                        <br />
                        D: The connection troubleshoot capability enables you to test a connection between a VM and
                        another VM, an FQDN, a URI, or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned
                        when using the connection monitor capability, but tests the connection at a point in time,
                        rather than monitoring it over time, as connection monitor does.

                        The virtual networks you peer must have non-overlapping IP address spaces. The exhibit indicates
                        that VNet1 has an address space of 10.2.0.0/16, which is the same as VNet2, and thus overlaps.
                        We need to change the address space for VNet1.

                    You have an Azure virtual network named VNet1 that connects to your on-premises network by using a
                    site-to-site VPN. VNet1 contains one subnet named
                    <br />
                    Subnet1.
                    <br />
                    Subnet1 is associated to a network security group (NSG) named NSG1. Subnet1 contains a basic
                    internal load balancer named ILB1. ILB1 has three Azure virtual machines in the backend pool.
                    <br />
                    You need to collect data about the IP addresses that connects to ILB1. You must be able to run
                    interactive queries from the Azure portal against the collected data.

                    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This
                    may take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.
                    <br />
                    When the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will
                    perform a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as
                    it would be in a live environment, some functionality (e.g, copy and paste, ability to navigate to
                    external websites) will not be possible by design.
                    <br />
                    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it
                    doesn't matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for
                    that task.
                    <br />
                    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You
                    can use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time
                    appropriately to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam
                    in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be
                    able to return to the lab.
                    <br />
                    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

                    You plan to deploy several Azure virtual machines and to connect them to a virtual network named
                    VNET1007.
                    <br />
                    You need to ensure that future virtual machines on VNET1007 can register their name in an internal
                    DNS zone named corp9172795.com. The zone must NOT be hosted on a virtual machine.

                    To complete this task, start Azure Cloud Shell and select PowerShell (Linux). Click Show Advanced
                    Settings, and then enter corp9172795n1 in the

                        Every new Azure AD tenant comes with an initial domain name, domainname.onmicrosoft.com. You
                        can't change or delete the initial domain name, but you can add your organization's names to the
                        list. Adding custom domain names helps you to create user names that are familiar to your users,
                        such as alain@contoso.com.

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance is an insurance company that has three offices in Miami, Tokyo and Bangkok. Each
                    office has 5,000 users.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Environment -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com. The
                    functional level of the forest is Windows Server 2012.
                    <br />
                    You recently provisioned an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Network Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a
                    dedicated connection to the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Issue -
                    <br />
                    Several users in humongousinsurance.com have UPNs that contain special characters.
                    <br />
                    You suspect that some of the characters are unsupported in Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Licensing Issue -
                    <br />
                    You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message:
                    "Licenses not assigned. License assignment failed for one user."
                    <br />
                    You verify that the Azure subscription has the available licenses.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements -
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4
                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.

                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com. The
                    functional level of the forest is Windows Server 2012.

                    Network Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a
                    dedicated connection to the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers.

                    Active Directory Issue -
                    <br />
                    Several users in humongousinsurance.com have UPNs that contain special characters.
                    <br />
                    You suspect that some of the characters are unsupported in Azure AD.
                    <br />

                    Licensing Issue -
                    <br />
                    You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message:
                    "Licenses not assigned. License assignment failed for one user."

                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4
                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.

                    Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com. The

                    <br />
                    Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a
                    dedicated connection to the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers.

                    Active Directory Issue -
                    <br />

                    You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message:
                    "Licenses not assigned. License assignment failed for one user."
                    <br />

                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4
                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2,
                    Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.
                    <br />

                    Department Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance identifies the following requirements for the company's departments:
                    <br />
                    Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be
                    added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The
                    web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.
                    <br />
                    During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs
                    from the past week.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless
                    SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.

                        Every Azure AD directory comes with an initial domain name in the form of
                        domainname.onmicrosoft.com. The initial domain name cannot be changed or deleted, but you can
                        add your corporate domain name to Azure AD as well. For example, your organization probably has
                        other domain names used to do business and users who sign in using your corporate domain name.
                        Adding custom domain names to Azure AD allows you to assign user names in the directory that are
                        familiar to your users, such as "Àúalice@contoso.com.' instead of 'alice@domain
                        name.onmicrosoft.com'.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Environment -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com. The
                    functional level of the forest is Windows Server 2012.
                    <br />
                    You recently provisioned an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Network Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a
                    dedicated connection to the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Issue -
                    <br />
                    Several users in humongousinsurance.com have UPNs that contain special characters.
                    <br />
                    You suspect that some of the characters are unsupported in Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Licensing Issue -
                    <br />
                    You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message:
                    "Licenses not assigned. License assignment failed for one user."
                    <br />
                    You verify that the Azure subscription has the available licenses.
                    <br />

                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4
                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2,
                    Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Department Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance identifies the following requirements for the company's departments:
                    <br />
                    Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be
                    added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The
                    web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.
                    <br />
                    During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs
                    from the past week.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Authentication Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless
                    SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance is an insurance company that has three offices in Miami, Tokyo and Bangkok. Each
                    office has 5,000 users.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Environment -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com. The
                    functional level of the forest is Windows Server 2012.
                    <br />
                    You recently provisioned an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Network Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a
                    dedicated connection to the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Issue -
                    <br />
                    Several users in humongousinsurance.com have UPNs that contain special characters.
                    <br />
                    You suspect that some of the characters are unsupported in Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Licensing Issue -
                    <br />
                    You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message:
                    "Licenses not assigned. License assignment failed for one user."
                    <br />
                    You verify that the Azure subscription has the available licenses.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4
                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2,
                    Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Department Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance identifies the following requirements for the company's departments:
                    <br />
                    Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be
                    added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The
                    web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.
                    <br />
                    During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs
                    from the past week.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Authentication Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless
                    SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.

                        D: You can gradually roll out Seamless SSO to your users. You start by adding the following
                        Azure AD URL to all or selected users' Intranet zone settings by using
                        <br />

                        <br />
                        E: Seamless SSO works with any method of cloud authentication - Password Hash Synchronization or
                        Pass-through Authentication, and can be enabled via Azure
                        <br />

                        <br />
                        Incorrect Answers:
                        <br />
                        A: Seamless SSO is not applicable to Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).
                        <br />
                        B: Azure AD connect does not port 8080. It uses port 443.
                        <br />
                        C: Seamless SSO needs the user's device to be domain-joined, but doesn't need for the device to
                        be Azure AD Joined.
                        <br />
                        Scenario: Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on
                        (Azure AD Seamless SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.
                        <br />
                        Planned Azure AD Infrastructure include: The on-premises Active Directory domain will be
                        synchronized to Azure AD.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -

                    A processing middle tier
                    <br />
                    Each tier is comprised of five virtual machines. Users access the web front end by using HTTPS only.
                    <br />

                    Create a hybrid directory to support an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 migration project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Technical Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups.
                    <br />
                    Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary.
                    <br />
                    Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwords from being stored in Azure.
                    <br />
                    Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile
                    phone to verify their identity
                    <br />
                    Minimize administrative effort whenever possible

                    Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service admin for the Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Admin1 must receive email alerts regarding service outages.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription.

                        A Recovery Services vault is a logical container that stores the backup data for each protected
                        resource, such as Azure VMs. When the backup job for a protected resource runs, it creates a

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance is an insurance company that has three offices in Miami, Tokyo and Bangkok. Each
                    office has 5,000 users.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Environment -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com. The
                    functional level of the forest is Windows Server 2012.
                    <br />
                    You recently provisioned an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Network Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a
                    dedicated connection to the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Issue -
                    <br />
                    Several users in humongousinsurance.com have UPNs that contain special characters.
                    <br />
                    You suspect that some of the characters are unsupported in Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Licensing Issue -
                    <br />
                    You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message:
                    "Licenses not assigned. License assignment failed for one user."
                    <br />
                    You verify that the Azure subscription has the available licenses.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4
                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2,
                    Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.
                    <br />

                    Department Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance identifies the following requirements for the company's departments:
                    <br />
                    Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be
                    added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The
                    web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.
                    <br />
                    During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs
                    from the past week.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Authentication Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless
                    SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.

                        app will be added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will
                        be identical. The web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Contoso, Ltd. is a consulting company that has a main office in Montreal and two branch offices in
                    Seattle and New York.
                    <br />
                    The Montreal office has 2,000 employees. The Seattle office has 1,000 employees. The New York office
                    has 200 employees.
                    <br />
                    All the resources used by Contoso are hosted on-premises.
                    <br />
                    Contoso creates a new Azure subscription. The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant uses a domain
                    named contoso.onmicrosoft.com. The tenant uses the
                    <br />
                    P1 pricing tier.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    The network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All domain controllers are
                    configured as DNS servers and host the contoso.com DNS zone.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has finance, human resources, sales, research, and information technology departments. Each
                    department has an organizational unit (OU) that contains all the accounts of that respective
                    department. All the user accounts have the department attribute set to their respective department.
                    New users are added frequently.
                    <br />
                    Contoso.com contains a user named User1.
                    <br />
                    All the offices connect by using private links.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has data centers in the Montreal and Seattle offices. Each data center has a firewall that
                    can be configured as a VPN device.
                    <br />
                    All infrastructure servers are virtualized. The virtualization environment contains the servers in
                    the following table.

                    <br />
                    Contoso uses two web applications named App1 and App2. Each instance on each web application
                    requires 1GB of memory.
                    <br />
                    The Azure subscription contains the resources in the following table.

                    <br />
                    The network security team implements several network security groups (NSGs).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to implement the following changes:
                    <br />
                    Deploy Azure ExpressRoute to the Montreal office.
                    <br />
                    Migrate the virtual machines hosted on Server1 and Server2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Synchronize on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
                    <br />
                    Migrate App1 and App2 to two Azure web apps named WebApp1 and WebApp2.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Technical requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Ensure that WebApp1 can adjust the number of instances automatically based on the load and can scale
                    up to five instances.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that VM3 can establish outbound connections over TCP port 8080 to the applications servers in
                    the Montreal office.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that routing information is exchanged automatically between Azure and the routers in the
                    Montreal office.
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"
                        src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03048/0018500009.png" />
                    <br />
                    Ensure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the users in the finance department only.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that webapp2.azurewebsites.net can be accessed by using the name app2.contoso.com
                    <br />
                    Connect the New York office to VNet1 over the Internet by using an encrypted connection.
                    <br />
                    Create a workflow to send an email message when the settings of VM4 are modified.
                    <br />
                    Create a custom Azure role named Role1 that is based on the Reader role.
                    <br />
                    Minimize costs whenever possible.

                    You discover that VM3 does NOT meet the technical requirements.
                    <br />
                    You need to verify whether the issue relates to the NSGs.

                        IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine. The
                        information consists of direction, protocol, local IP, remote IP, local port, and remote port.
                        If the packet is denied by a security group, the name of the rule that denied the packet is
                        returned. While any source or destination IP can be chosen,
                        <br />
                        IP flow verify helps administrators quickly diagnose connectivity issues from or to the internet
                        and from or to the on-premises environment.

                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.

                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2

                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.

                    Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2,
                    Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.

                    <br />
                    Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be
                    added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The
                    web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.
                    <br />
                    During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs
                    from the past week.

                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4
                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2,
                    Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.
                    <br />

                    Department Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance identifies the following requirements for the company's departments:
                    <br />
                    Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be
                    added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The
                    web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.
                    <br />
                    During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs
                    from the past week.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Authentication Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless
                    SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.

                        Once the VNets are peered, all resources on one VNet can communicate with resources on the other

                        All Azure resources connected to a VNet have outbound connectivity to the Internet by default.
                        Therefore VMs on ClientSubnet, which is on ClientResources-VNet will have access to the
                        Internet; and VMs on Subnet3 and Subnet4, which are on AllOffices-VNet will have access to the

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Contoso, Ltd. is a consulting company that has a main office in Montreal and two branch offices in
                    Seattle and New York.
                    <br />
                    The Montreal office has 2,000 employees. The Seattle office has 1,000 employees. The New York office
                    has 200 employees.
                    <br />
                    All the resources used by Contoso are hosted on-premises.
                    <br />
                    Contoso creates a new Azure subscription. The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant uses a domain
                    named contoso.onmicrosoft.com. The tenant uses the
                    <br />
                    P1 pricing tier.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    The network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All domain controllers are
                    configured as DNS servers and host the contoso.com DNS zone.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has finance, human resources, sales, research, and information technology departments. Each
                    department has an organizational unit (OU) that contains all the accounts of that respective
                    department. All the user accounts have the department attribute set to their respective department.
                    New users are added frequently.
                    <br />
                    Contoso.com contains a user named User1.
                    <br />
                    All the offices connect by using private links.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has data centers in the Montreal and Seattle offices. Each data center has a firewall that
                    can be configured as a VPN device.
                    <br />
                    All infrastructure servers are virtualized. The virtualization environment contains the servers in
                    the following table.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Contoso uses two web applications named App1 and App2. Each instance on each web application
                    requires 1GB of memory.
                    <br />
                    The Azure subscription contains the resources in the following table.
                    <br />

                    Technical requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Ensure that WebApp1 can adjust the number of instances automatically based on the load and can scale
                    up to five instances.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that VM3 can establish outbound connections over TCP port 8080 to the applications servers in
                    the Montreal office.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that routing information is exchanged automatically between Azure and the routers in the
                    Montreal office.
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"

                    <br />
                    Ensure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the users in the finance department only.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that webapp2.azurewebsites.net can be accessed by using the name app2.contoso.com
                    <br />
                    Connect the New York office to VNet1 over the Internet by using an encrypted connection.
                    <br />
                    Create a workflow to send an email message when the settings of VM4 are modified.
                    <br />
                    Create a custom Azure role named Role1 that is based on the Reader role.
                    <br />
                    Minimize costs whenever possible.

                        <br />
                        Azure VPN gateway. The VPN gateway service enables you to connect the VNet to the on-premises
                        network through a VPN appliance. For more information, see
                        <br />
                        Connect an on-premises network to a Microsoft Azure virtual network. The VPN gateway includes
                        the following elements:
                        <br />
                        ‚úë Virtual network gateway. A resource that provides a virtual VPN appliance for the VNet. It is
                        responsible for routing traffic from the on-premises network to the
                        <br />
                        VNet.
                        <br />
                        ‚úë Local network gateway. An abstraction of the on-premises VPN appliance. Network traffic from
                        the cloud application to the on-premises network is routed through this gateway.
                        <br />
                        ‚úë Connection. The connection has properties that specify the connection type (IPSec) and the key
                        shared with the on-premises VPN appliance to encrypt traffic.
                        <br />
                        ‚úë Gateway subnet. The virtual network gateway is held in its own subnet, which is subject to
                        various requirements, described in the Recommendations section below.
                        <br />
                        Box 2: Configure a site-to-site VPN connection

                        On premises create a site-to-site connection for the virtual network gateway and the local
                        network gateway.

                    Technical Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups.
                    <br />
                    Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary.
                    <br />
                    Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwords from being stored in Azure.
                    <br />
                    Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile
                    phone to verify their identity
                    <br />
                    Minimize administrative effort whenever possible
                    <br />

                    Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service admin for the Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Admin1 must receive email alerts regarding service outages.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    Currently, Contoso uses multiple types of servers for business operations, including the following:
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    A processing middle tier
                    <br />
                    Each tier is comprised of five virtual machines. Users access the web front end by using HTTPS only.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements -
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to implement the following changes to the infrastructure:
                    <br />
                    Move all the tiers of App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Move the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage.
                    <br />
                    Create a hybrid directory to support an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 migration project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Technical Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups.
                    <br />
                    Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary.
                    <br />
                    Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwords from being stored in Azure.
                    <br />
                    Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile
                    phone to verify their identity
                    <br />
                    Minimize administrative effort whenever possible
                    <br />

                    Contoso identifies the following requirements for users:
                    <br />
                    Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service admin for the Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Admin1 must receive email alerts regarding service outages.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription.

                    <br />
                    Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers.
                    <br />

                    Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary.
                    <br />
                    Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwords from being stored in Azure.
                    <br />
                    Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile
                    phone to verify their identity
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service admin for the Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Admin1 must receive email alerts regarding service outages.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription.

                        Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Pass-through Authentication allows users to sign in to both

                    Technical Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups.
                    <br />
                    Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary.
                    <br />
                    Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwords from being stored in Azure.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile
                    phone to verify their identity
                    <br />
                    Minimize administrative effort whenever possible

                    <br />
                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Contoso, Ltd. is a consulting company that has a main office in Montreal and two branch offices in
                    Seattle and New York.
                    <br />
                    The Montreal office has 2,000 employees. The Seattle office has 1,000 employees. The New York office
                    has 200 employees.
                    <br />
                    All the resources used by Contoso are hosted on-premises.
                    <br />
                    Contoso creates a new Azure subscription. The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant uses a domain
                    named contoso.onmicrosoft.com. The tenant uses the
                    <br />
                    P1 pricing tier.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    The network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All domain controllers are
                    configured as DNS servers and host the contoso.com DNS zone.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has finance, human resources, sales, research, and information technology departments. Each
                    department has an organizational unit (OU) that contains all the accounts of that respective
                    department. All the user accounts have the department attribute set to their respective department.
                    New users are added frequently.
                    <br />
                    Contoso.com contains a user named User1.
                    <br />
                    All the offices connect by using private links.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has data centers in the Montreal and Seattle offices. Each data center has a firewall that
                    can be configured as a VPN device.
                    <br />
                    All infrastructure servers are virtualized. The virtualization environment contains the servers in
                    the following table.

                    <br />
                    Contoso uses two web applications named App1 and App2. Each instance on each web application
                    requires 1GB of memory.
                    <br />
                    The Azure subscription contains the resources in the following table.

                    <br />
                    The network security team implements several network security groups (NSGs).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to implement the following changes:
                    <br />
                    Deploy Azure ExpressRoute to the Montreal office.
                    <br />
                    Migrate the virtual machines hosted on Server1 and Server2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Synchronize on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
                    <br />
                    Migrate App1 and App2 to two Azure web apps named WebApp1 and WebApp2.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Technical requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Ensure that WebApp1 can adjust the number of instances automatically based on the load and can scale
                    up to five instances.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that VM3 can establish outbound connections over TCP port 8080 to the applications servers in
                    the Montreal office.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that routing information is exchanged automatically between Azure and the routers in the
                    Montreal office.
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"
                        src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03048/0035000009.png" />
                    <br />
                    Ensure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the users in the finance department only.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that webapp2.azurewebsites.net can be accessed by using the name app2.contoso.com
                    <br />
                    Connect the New York office to VNet1 over the Internet by using an encrypted connection.
                    <br />
                    Create a workflow to send an email message when the settings of VM4 are modified.
                    <br />
                    Create a custom Azure role named Role1 that is based on the Reader role.
                    <br />
                    Minimize costs whenever possible.

                        Scenario: Ensure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the users in the finance department
                        only.
                        <br />
                        The recommendation is to use conditional access policies that can then be targeted to groups of
                        users, specific applications, or other conditions.

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Contoso, Ltd. is a consulting company that has a main office in Montreal and two branch offices in
                    Seattle and New York.
                    <br />
                    The Montreal office has 2,000 employees. The Seattle office has 1,000 employees. The New York office
                    has 200 employees.
                    <br />
                    All the resources used by Contoso are hosted on-premises.
                    <br />
                    Contoso creates a new Azure subscription. The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant uses a domain
                    named contoso.onmicrosoft.com. The tenant uses the
                    <br />
                    P1 pricing tier.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    The network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All domain controllers are
                    configured as DNS servers and host the contoso.com DNS zone.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has finance, human resources, sales, research, and information technology departments. Each
                    department has an organizational unit (OU) that contains all the accounts of that respective
                    department. All the user accounts have the department attribute set to their respective department.
                    New users are added frequently.
                    <br />
                    Contoso.com contains a user named User1.
                    <br />
                    All the offices connect by using private links.
                    <br />
                    Contoso has data centers in the Montreal and Seattle offices. Each data center has a firewall that
                    can be configured as a VPN device.
                    <br />
                    All infrastructure servers are virtualized. The virtualization environment contains the servers in
                    the following table.

                    <br />
                    Contoso uses two web applications named App1 and App2. Each instance on each web application
                    requires 1GB of memory.
                    <br />
                    The Azure subscription contains the resources in the following table.

                    <br />
                    The network security team implements several network security groups (NSGs).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to implement the following changes:
                    <br />
                    Deploy Azure ExpressRoute to the Montreal office.
                    <br />
                    Migrate the virtual machines hosted on Server1 and Server2 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Synchronize on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
                    <br />
                    Migrate App1 and App2 to two Azure web apps named WebApp1 and WebApp2.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Technical requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Ensure that WebApp1 can adjust the number of instances automatically based on the load and can scale
                    up to five instances.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that VM3 can establish outbound connections over TCP port 8080 to the applications servers in
                    the Montreal office.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that routing information is exchanged automatically between Azure and the routers in the
                    Montreal office.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Ensure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the users in the finance department only.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that webapp2.azurewebsites.net can be accessed by using the name app2.contoso.com
                    <br />
                    Connect the New York office to VNet1 over the Internet by using an encrypted connection.
                    <br />
                    Create a workflow to send an email message when the settings of VM4 are modified.
                    <br />
                    Create a custom Azure role named Role1 that is based on the Reader role.
                    <br />
                    Minimize costs whenever possible.

                        Increasing the update domain (platformUpdateDomainCount) helps with capacity and availability
                        planning when the platform reboots nodes. A higher number for the pool (20 is max) means that
                        fewer of their nodes in any given availability set would be rebooted at once.

                        At a high level, an import job involves the following steps:
                        <br />
                        Step 1: Attach an external disk to Server1 and then run waimportexport.exe
                        <br />
                        Determine data to be imported, number of drives you need, destination blob location for your
                        data in Azure storage.
                        <br />
                        Use the WAImportExport tool to copy data to disk drives. Encrypt the disk drives with BitLocker.
                        <br />
                        Step 2: From the Azure portal, create an import job.
                        <br />
                        Create an import job in your target storage account in Azure portal. Upload the drive journal
                        files.
                        <br />
                        Step 3: Detach the external disks from Server1 and ship the disks to an Azure data center.
                        <br />
                        Provide the return address and carrier account number for shipping the drives back to you.
                        <br />
                        Ship the disk drives to the shipping address provided during job creation.
                        <br />
                        Step 4: From the Azure portal, update the import job
                        <br />
                        Update the delivery tracking number in the import job details and submit the import job.
                        <br />
                        The drives are received and processed at the Azure data center.
                        <br />
                        The drives are shipped using your carrier account to the return address provided in the import
                        job.

                    You have an on-premises file server named Server1 that runs Windows Server 2016.
                    <br />
                    You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure file share.
                    <br />
                    You deploy an Azure File Sync Storage Sync Service, and you create a sync group.
                    <br />
                    You need to synchronize files from Server1 to Azure.

                        Step 1: Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1
                        <br />
                        The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced
                        with an Azure file share
                        <br />
                        Step 2: Register Server1.
                        <br />
                        Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service
                        <br />
                        Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship
                        between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Step 3: Add a server endpoint -
                        <br />
                        Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.
                        <br />
                        A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are
                        kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an
                        Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on
                        registered server.

                    You have an availability set named AS1 that contains three virtual machines named VM1, VM2, and VM3.
                    <br />
                    You attempt to reconfigure VM1 to use a larger size. The operation fails and you receive an

                        Step 1: Stop VM1, VM, and VM3.
                        <br />
                        If the VM you wish to resize is part of an availability set, then you must stop all VMs in the
                        availability set before changing the size of any VM in the availability set.
                        <br />
                        The reason all VMs in the availability set must be stopped before performing the resize
                        operation to a size that requires different hardware is that all running VMs in the availability
                        set must be using the same physical hardware cluster. Therefore, if a change of physical
                        hardware cluster is required to change the VM size then all VMs must be first stopped and then
                        restarted one-by-one to a different physical hardware clusters.
                        <br />
                        Step 2: Resize VM1.
                        <br />
                        Step 3: Start VM1, VM2, and VM3.

                    This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is
                    provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide
                    more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is
                    independent of the other questions in this case study.

                    At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your
                    answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new
                    section, you cannot return to this section.

                    <br />
                    Contoso, Ltd. is a manufacturing company that has offices worldwide. Contoso works with partner
                    organizations to bring products to market.
                    <br />
                    Contoso products are manufactured by using blueprint files that the company authors and maintains.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    Currently, Contoso uses multiple types of servers for business operations, including the following:
                    <br />
                    File servers
                    <br />
                    Domain controllers
                    <br />
                    Microsoft SQL Server servers
                    <br />
                    Your network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All servers and client computers
                    are joined to Active Directory.
                    <br />
                    You have a public-facing application named App1. App1 is comprised of the following three tiers:
                    <br />
                    A SQL database
                    <br />
                    A web front end
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A processing middle tier -
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"
                        src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03048/n42472200000.png" />
                    <br />
                    Each tier is comprised of five virtual machines. Users access the web front end by using HTTPS only.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements -

                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to implement the following changes to the infrastructure:
                    <br />
                    Move all the tiers of App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Move the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage.
                    <br />
                    Create a hybrid directory to support an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 migration project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Technical Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups.
                    <br />
                    Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary.
                    <br />
                    Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwprds from being stored in Azure.
                    <br />
                    Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile
                    phone to verify their identity
                    <br />
                    Minimize administrative effort whenever possible
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    User Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso identifies the following requirements for users:
                    <br />
                    Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service admin for the Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Admin1 must receive email alerts regarding service outages.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription.

                    Network Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a
                    dedicated connection to the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers.

                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2,
                    Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance is an insurance company that has three offices in Miami, Tokyo and Bangkok. Each
                    office has 5.000 users.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Environment -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com. The
                    functional level of the forest is Windows Server 2012.
                    <br />
                    You recently provisioned an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Network Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a
                    dedicated connection to the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Issue -
                    <br />
                    Several users in humongousinsurance.com have UPNs that contain special characters.
                    <br />
                    You suspect that some of the characters are unsupported in Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Licensing Issue -
                    <br />
                    You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message:
                    "Licenses not assigned. License assignment failed for one user."
                    <br />
                    You verify that the Azure subscription has the available licenses.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2

                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2,
                    Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.
                    <br />

                    web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.
                    <br />
                    During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs
                    from the past week.

                    You have an Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    You plan to use Azure Resource Manager templates to deploy 50 Azure virtual machines that will be

                        Use 20 for platformUpdateDomainCount

                        Increasing the update domain (platformUpdateDomainCount) helps with capacity and availability
                        planning when the platform reboots nodes. A higher number for the pool (20 is max) means that
                        fewer of their nodes in any given availability set would be rebooted at once.

                        At a high level, an import job involves the following steps:
                        <br />
                        Step 1: Attach an external disk to Server1 and then run waimportexport.exe
                        <br />
                        Determine data to be imported, number of drives you need, destination blob location for your
                        data in Azure storage.
                        <br />
                        Use the WAImportExport tool to copy data to disk drives. Encrypt the disk drives with BitLocker.
                        <br />
                        Step 2: From the Azure portal, create an import job.
                        <br />
                        Create an import job in your target storage account in Azure portal. Upload the drive journal
                        files.
                        <br />
                        Step 3: Detach the external disks from Server1 and ship the disks to an Azure data center.
                        <br />
                        Provide the return address and carrier account number for shipping the drives back to you.

                        Step 1: Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1
                        <br />
                        The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced
                        with an Azure file share
                        <br />
                        Step 2: Register Server1.
                        <br />
                        Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service
                        <br />
                        Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship
                        between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Step 3: Add a server endpoint -
                        <br />
                        Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.
                        <br />
                        A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are
                        kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an
                        Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on
                        registered server.

                    This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
                    <br />
                    To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is
                    provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide
                    more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is
                    independent of the other questions in this case study.
                    <br />
                    At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your
                    answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new
                    section, you cannot return to this section.

                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    Currently, Contoso uses multiple types of servers for business operations, including the following:
                    <br />
                    File servers
                    <br />
                    Domain controllers
                    <br />
                    Microsoft SQL Server servers
                    <br />
                    Your network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All servers and client computers
                    are joined to Active Directory.
                    <br />
                    You have a public-facing application named App1. App1 is comprised of the following three tiers:
                    <br />
                    A SQL database
                    <br />
                    A web front end
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A processing middle tier -
                    <br />

                        src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03048/n47578200000.png" />
                    <br />
                    Each tier is comprised of five virtual machines. Users access the web front end by using HTTPS only.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements -

                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to implement the following changes to the infrastructure:
                    <br />
                    Move all the tiers of App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Move the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage.
                    <br />
                    Create a hybrid directory to support an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 migration project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Technical Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups.
                    <br />
                    Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary.
                    <br />
                    Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwprds from being stored in Azure.
                    <br />
                    Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile
                    phone to verify their identity
                    <br />
                    Minimize administrative effort whenever possible
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    User Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso identifies the following requirements for users:
                    <br />
                    Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service admin for the Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Admin1 must receive email alerts regarding service outages.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription.

                    <br />
                    Active Directory Environment -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com. The
                    functional level of the forest is Windows Server 2012.
                    <br />
                    You recently provisioned an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Network Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a
                    dedicated connection to the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Issue -
                    <br />
                    Several users in humongousinsurance.com have UPNs that contain special characters.
                    <br />
                    You suspect that some of the characters are unsupported in Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Licensing Issue -
                    <br />
                    You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message:
                    "Licenses not assigned. License assignment failed for one user."
                    <br />
                    You verify that the Azure subscription has the available licenses.
                    <br />

                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4
                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2,
                    Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Department Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance identifies the following requirements for the company's departments:
                    <br />
                    Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be
                    added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The
                    web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.
                    <br />
                    During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs
                    from the past week.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Authentication Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless
                    SSO) when accessing resources in Azure.
                    <span class="inquestion-subtitle mb-0 mt-3">
                        Question
                    </span>
                    DRAG DROP -
                    <br />
                    You need to prepare the environment to ensure that the web administrators can deploy the web apps as

                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance is an insurance company that has three offices in Miami, Tokyo and Bangkok. Each
                    office has 5,000 users.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Environment -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com. The
                    functional level of the forest is Windows Server 2012.
                    <br />
                    You recently provisioned an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Network Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a
                    dedicated connection to the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Active Directory Issue -
                    <br />
                    Several users in humongousinsurance.com have UPNs that contain special characters.
                    <br />
                    You suspect that some of the characters are unsupported in Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Licensing Issue -
                    <br />
                    You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message:
                    "Licenses not assigned. License assignment failed for one user."
                    <br />
                    You verify that the Azure subscription has the available licenses.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users
                    who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will
                    be hosted in Azure.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure -
                    <br />
                    The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources:
                    <br />
                    Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet
                    <br />
                    A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4
                    <br />
                    You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote
                    gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings.
                    <br />
                    You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration
                    network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network.
                    <br />
                    Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure
                    <br />
                    Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2,
                    Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Department Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Humongous Insurance identifies the following requirements for the company's departments:
                    <br />
                    Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be
                    added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The
                    web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups.
                    <br />
                    During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs
                    from the past week.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                        Use 20 for platformUpdateDomainCount
                        <br />
                        Increasing the update domain (platformUpdateDomainCount) helps with capacity and availability
                        planning when the platform reboots nodes. A higher number for the pool (20 is max) means that
                        fewer of their nodes in any given availability set would be rebooted at once.

                        Step 1: Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1
                        <br />
                        The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced
                        with an Azure file share
                        <br />
                        Step 2: Register Server1.
                        <br />
                        Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service
                        <br />
                        Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship
                        between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Step 3: Add a server endpoint -
                        <br />
                        Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.
                        <br />
                        A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are
                        kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an
                        Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on
                        registered server.

                        At a high level, an import job involves the following steps:
                        <br />
                        Step 1: Attach an external disk to Server1 and then run waimportexport.exe
                        <br />
                        Determine data to be imported, number of drives you need, destination blob location for your

                        <br />
                        Use the WAImportExport tool to copy data to disk drives. Encrypt the disk drives with BitLocker.
                        <br />
                        Step 2: From the Azure portal, create an import job.
                        <br />
                        Create an import job in your target storage account in Azure portal. Upload the drive journal

                        <br />
                        Step 3: Detach the external disks from Server1 and ship the disks to an Azure data center.

                        Provide the return address and carrier account number for shipping the drives back to you.
                        <br />
                        Ship the disk drives to the shipping address provided during job creation.
                        <br />
                        Step 4: From the Azure portal, update the import job
                        <br />
                        Update the delivery tracking number in the import job details and submit the import job.
                        <br />
                        The drives are received and processed at the Azure data center.
                        <br />
                        The drives are shipped using your carrier account to the return address provided in the import
                        job.

                    <br />
                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Contoso, Ltd. is a manufacturing company that has offices worldwide. Contoso works with partner
                    organizations to bring products to market.
                    <br />
                    Contoso products are manufactured by using blueprint files that the company authors and maintains.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    Currently, Contoso uses multiple types of servers for business operations, including the following:
                    <br />
                    File servers
                    <br />
                    Domain controllers
                    <br />
                    Microsoft SQL Server servers
                    <br />
                    Your network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All servers and client computers
                    are joined to Active Directory.
                    <br />
                    You have a public-facing application named App1. App1 is comprised of the following three tiers:
                    <br />
                    A SQL database
                    <br />
                    A web front end
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A processing middle tier -
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"
                        src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03048/n45364100000.png" />
                    <br />
                    Each tier is comprised of five virtual machines. Users access the web front end by using HTTPS only.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements -
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to implement the following changes to the infrastructure:
                    <br />
                    Move all the tiers of App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Move the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage.
                    <br />
                    Create a hybrid directory to support an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 migration project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Technical Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups.
                    <br />
                    Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary.
                    <br />
                    Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwprds from being stored in Azure.
                    <br />
                    Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile
                    phone to verify their identity
                    <br />
                    Minimize administrative effort whenever possible
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    User Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso identifies the following requirements for users:
                    <br />
                    Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service admin for the Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Admin1 must receive email alerts regarding service outages.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription.

                        fewer of their nodes in any given availability set would be rebooted at once.

                        At a high level, an import job involves the following steps:
                        <br />
                        Step 1: Attach an external disk to Server1 and then run waimportexport.exe
                        <br />
                        Determine data to be imported, number of drives you need, destination blob location for your
                        data in Azure storage.
                        <br />
                        Use the WAImportExport tool to copy data to disk drives. Encrypt the disk drives with BitLocker.
                        <br />
                        Step 2: From the Azure portal, create an import job.
                        <br />
                        Create an import job in your target storage account in Azure portal. Upload the drive journal
                        files.
                        <br />
                        Step 3: Detach the external disks from Server1 and ship the disks to an Azure data center.
                        <br />
                        Provide the return address and carrier account number for shipping the drives back to you.
                        <br />
                        Ship the disk drives to the shipping address provided during job creation.
                        <br />
                        Step 4: From the Azure portal, update the import job
                        <br />
                        Update the delivery tracking number in the import job details and submit the import job.
                        <br />
                        The drives are received and processed at the Azure data center.
                        <br />
                        The drives are shipped using your carrier account to the return address provided in the import
                        job.

                        Step 1: Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1
                        <br />
                        The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced
                        with an Azure file share
                        <br />
                        Step 2: Register Server1.
                        <br />
                        Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service
                        <br />
                        Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship
                        between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Step 3: Add a server endpoint -
                        <br />
                        Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.
                        <br />
                        A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are
                        kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an
                        Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on
                        registered server.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Overview -
                    <br />
                    Contoso, Ltd. is a manufacturing company that has offices worldwide. Contoso works with partner
                    organizations to bring products to market.
                    <br />
                    Contoso products are manufactured by using blueprint files that the company authors and maintains.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Existing Environment -
                    <br />
                    Currently, Contoso uses multiple types of servers for business operations, including the following:
                    <br />
                    File servers
                    <br />
                    Domain controllers
                    <br />
                    Microsoft SQL Server servers
                    <br />
                    Your network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All servers and client computers
                    are joined to Active Directory.
                    <br />
                    You have a public-facing application named App1. App1 is comprised of the following three tiers:
                    <br />
                    A SQL database
                    <br />
                    A web front end
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A processing middle tier -
                    <br />
                    <img class="in-exam-image"
                        src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/03048/n46582300000.png" />
                    <br />
                    Each tier is comprised of five virtual machines. Users access the web front end by using HTTPS only.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Requirements -
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Planned Changes -
                    <br />
                    Contoso plans to implement the following changes to the infrastructure:
                    <br />
                    Move all the tiers of App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Move the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage.
                    <br />
                    Create a hybrid directory to support an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 migration project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Technical Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso must meet the following technical requirements:
                    <br />
                    Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure.
                    <br />
                    Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups.
                    <br />
                    Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary.
                    <br />
                    Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwprds from being stored in Azure.
                    <br />
                    Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile
                    phone to verify their identity
                    <br />
                    Minimize administrative effort whenever possible
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    User Requirements -
                    <br />
                    Contoso identifies the following requirements for users:
                    <br />
                    Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD.
                    <br />
                    Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service admin for the Azure subscription.
                    <br />
                    Admin1 must receive email alerts regarding service outages.
                    <br />
                    Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription.

                    You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that runs Windows Server 2016.
                    <br />
                    You need to create an alert in Azure when more than two error events are logged to the System log on
                    VM1 within an hour.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You create an event subscription on VM1. You create an alert in Azure Monitor and specify
                    VM1 as the source.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                        Alerts in Azure Monitor can identify important information in your Log Analytics repository.
                        They are created by alert rules that automatically run log searches at regular intervals, and if
                        results of the log search match particular criteria, then an alert record is created and it can
                        be configured to perform an automated response.
                        <br />
                        The Log Analytics agent collects monitoring data from the guest operating system and workloads
                        of virtual machines in Azure, other cloud providers, and on- premises. It collects data into a
                        Log Analytics workspace.

                    You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë A virtual network that has a subnet named Subnet1
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Two network security groups (NSGs) named NSG-VM1 and NSG-Subnet1
                    <br />
                    ‚úë A virtual machine named VM1 that has the required Windows Server configurations to allow Remote
                    Desktop connections
                    <br />
                    NSG-Subnet1 has the default inbound security rules only.
                    <br />
                    NSG-VM1 has the default inbound security rules and the following custom inbound security rule:

                    VM1 connects to Subnet1. NSG1-VM1 is associated to the network interface of VM1. NSG-Subnet1 is
                    associated to Subnet1.
                    <br />
                    You need to be able to establish Remote Desktop connections from the internet to VM1.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You modify the custom rule for NSG-VM1 to use the internet as a source and TCP as a
                    protocol.

                    You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë A virtual network that has a subnet named Subnet1
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Two network security groups (NSGs) named NSG-VM1 and NSG-Subnet1
                    <br />
                    ‚úë A virtual machine named VM1 that has the required Windows Server configurations to allow Remote
                    Desktop connections
                    <br />
                    NSG-Subnet1 has the default inbound security rules only.
                    <br />
                    NSG-VM1 has the default inbound security rules and the following custom inbound security rule:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Priority: 100
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Source: Any
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Source port range: *
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Destination: *
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Destination port range: 3389
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Protocol: UDP
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Action: Allow
                    <br />
                    VM1 connects to Subnet1. NSG1-VM1 is associated to the network interface of VM1. NSG-Subnet1 is
                    associated to Subnet1.
                    <br />
                    You need to be able to establish Remote Desktop connections from the internet to VM1.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You add an inbound security rule to NSG-Subnet1 that allows connections from the Any
                    source to the * destination for port range 3389 and uses the TCP protocol. You remove NSG-VM1 from
                    the network interface of VM1.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                    You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë A virtual network that has a subnet named Subnet1
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Two network security groups (NSGs) named NSG-VM1 and NSG-Subnet1
                    <br />
                    ‚úë A virtual machine named VM1 that has the required Windows Server configurations to allow Remote
                    Desktop connections
                    <br />
                    NSG-Subnet1 has the default inbound security rules only.
                    <br />
                    NSG-VM1 has the default inbound security rules and the following custom inbound security rule:
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Priority: 100
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Source: Any
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Source port range: *
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Destination: *
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Destination port range: 3389
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Protocol: UDP
                    <br />
                    ‚úë Action: Allow
                    <br />
                    VM1 connects to Subnet1. NSG1-VM1 is associated to the network interface of VM1. NSG-Subnet1 is
                    associated to Subnet1.
                    <br />
                    You need to be able to establish Remote Desktop connections from the internet to VM1.
                    <br />
                    Solution: You add an inbound security rule to NSG-Subnet1 that allows connections from the Internet
                    source to the VirtualNetwork destination for port range 3389 and uses the UDP protocol.
                    <br />
                    Does this meet the goal?

                        Note: With the increase in usage of Office 365 Groups, administrators and users need a way to
                        clean up unused groups. Expiration policies can help remove inactive groups from the system and
                        make things cleaner.
                        <br />
                        When a group expires, all of its associated services (the mailbox, Planner, SharePoint site,

                        about how to troubleshoot each scenario.
                        <br />
                        Scenario 1: The "User must change password at next logon" check box is selected for the user's
                        account
                        <br />
                        To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
                        <br />
                        1. Do one of the following:
                        <br />
                        In the user account properties in Active Directory Users and Computers, clear the User must
                        change password at next logon check box.
                        <br />
                        Have the user change their on-premises user account password.
                        <br />
                        2. Wait a few minutes for the change to sync between the on-premises Active Directory Domain
                        Services (AD DS) and Azure AD.

                        <br />
                        Configuration options include:

                        Block user when fraud is reported: If a user reports fraud, their account is blocked for 90 days
                        or until an administrator unblocks their account. An administrator can review sign-ins by using
                        the sign-in report, and take appropriate action to prevent future fraud. An administrator can

                    You have an Azure virtual network named VNet1 that contains a subnet named Subnet1. Subnet1 contains
                    three Azure virtual machines. Each virtual machine has a public IP address.
                    <br />
                    The virtual machines host several applications that are accessible over port 443 to user on the

                    <br />
                    Your on-premises network has a site-to-site VPN connection to VNet1.
                    <br />
                    You discover that virtual machines can be accessed by using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) from
                    the Internet and from the on-premises network.
                    <br />
                    You need to prevent RDP access to the virtual machines from the Internet, unless the RDP connection
                    is established from the on-premises network. The solution must ensure that all the applications can
                    still be accesses by the Internet users.
